                <h2>Hello, I’m Ankita Pathak!</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my little corner of the web! I’m a <strong>Web Developer</strong>, <strong>Programmer</strong>, and a <strong>Machine Learning Enthusiast</strong>, passionate about blending technology and creativity to build solutions that matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, and from an early age, I found myself drawn to the world of technology. Whether it's coding a complex web application, building intelligent algorithms, or exploring the latest trends in AI, I’m always up for a challenge that pushes my boundaries and helps me grow.
                </p>

                <h2>What I Do:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web Development</strong>: I specialize in creating user-friendly, responsive websites and web applications. From clean, functional designs to robust backend systems, I enjoy building digital experiences that make a difference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning Enthusiast</strong>: My curiosity extends to the world of AI and machine learning. I’m constantly exploring how intelligent systems can be used to solve real-world problems and make processes more efficient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Photography and Creativity</strong>: Beyond my love for coding, I’m a passionate photographer. Capturing moments through my lens is how I express my creativity outside of tech. It's a balance between art and logic that I find truly fulfilling.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Journey:</h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up in <strong>Kolkata</strong>, I was always surrounded by vibrant culture and rich tradition, which sparked my curiosity and love for learning. Being a curious cat I explore new topics and often take interest in a variety of subjects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey hasn’t just been about technology, though. I’ve also been fortunate to capture the  <strong> beauty of nature</strong>, with <strong>Kolkata</strong> holding a special place in my heart for its diverse culture. I like to think of it as my creative retreat—whenever I need inspiration, I grab my camera and get lost in the old streets of Kolkata with the same old yellow taxis and street vendors
                </p>

                <h2>Why I Love What I Do:</h2>
                <p>
                    For me, it’s not just about writing code or building websites—it’s about solving problems, creating value, and making the web a better place for everyone. I believe that every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and create something that can have a positive impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I take pride in staying up to date with the latest technologies and trends in web development even though I am only a beginner, but what truly drives me is the opportunity to collaborate with others. Whether it’s a fellow developer, a client, or a creative team, I believe that working together produces the most innovative, meaningful results, and enrich our ideas
                </p>

                <h2>Let’s Connect!</h2>
                <p>
                    If you’re looking for a developer who’s passionate about technology and creativity, you’ve come to the right place. I’d love to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
